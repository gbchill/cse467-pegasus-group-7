# Operational Security (OpSec) Practices

## Device Compartmentalization

**Separate Devices for Different Purposes:**

- Personal communications
- Work/sensitive activities
- Public/less sensitive use

Compromise of one doesn't affect others.

## Communication Channel Selection

**For Highly Sensitive Communications:**

- In-person meetings (most secure)
- Dedicated secure devices
- Avoid SMS/regular calls
- Use Signal on dedicated device

## Regular Device Rotation

**High-Risk Users:**
- Replace primary device every 6-12 months
- Change phone number
- Factory reset old devices before disposal

## Travel Security

**When Traveling to High-Risk Countries:**

- Use burner devices
- Minimal data on device
- Avoid sensitive communications
- Enable full-disk encryption
- Power off when not in use
- Be aware of border device searches

## Social Engineering Awareness

Attackers may:
- Impersonate contacts
- Send compelling pretexts
- Create urgency

**Verification:**
- Verify unexpected requests through alternate channels
- Question urgency
- Be suspicious of unsolicited files/links

## Secure Disposal

**Before Discarding Device:**
1. Factory reset
2. Remove SIM/SD cards
3. Physical destruction if highly sensitive
4. Verify reset completion

## Key Principles

1. **Assume Compromise** - Plan for worst case
2. **Compartmentalize** - Separate sensitive from general use
3. **Verify Contacts** - Confirm identity through multiple channels
4. **Minimize Data** - Don't store what you don't need
5. **Physical Security** - Protect devices from tampering
