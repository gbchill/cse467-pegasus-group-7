# Security Terminology Glossary

## A

**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT):** Sophisticated, long-term cyberattack campaign typically conducted by nation-state actors.

**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** Security technique that randomizes memory addresses to make exploitation more difficult.

**Anti-Forensics:** Techniques used by malware to evade detection and analysis.

## C

**Command and Control (C2):** Infrastructure used by attackers to communicate with and control compromised devices.

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** Standardized identifier for publicly known security vulnerabilities.

## D

**Data Execution Prevention (DEP):** Security feature preventing code execution in data-only memory regions.

**Domain Fronting:** Technique to disguise the true destination of network traffic by using legitimate domains.

## E

**Exploit:** Code that takes advantage of a software vulnerability to cause unintended behavior.

**Exploit Chain:** Series of exploits used together to achieve a specific goal (e.g., full device compromise).

## I

**Indicator of Compromise (IOC):** Artifact suggesting a system has been compromised (e.g., malicious domain, suspicious file).

**IPC (Inter-Process Communication):** Mechanisms allowing processes to communicate with each other.

## J

**Jailbreak:** Process of removing iOS security restrictions to gain elevated privileges (unofficial).

## K

**Kernel:** Core component of an operating system with complete hardware access and highest privileges.

## M

**Memory Corruption:** Bug causing unintended memory access, often exploitable for code execution.

**Mobile Device Management (MDM):** Enterprise system for managing and securing mobile devices.

## N

**NSO Group:** Israeli company that developed Pegasus spyware.

## P

**Pegasus:** Sophisticated mobile spyware developed by NSO Group.

**Persistence:** Malware's ability to maintain access across reboots and updates.

**Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher access levels than initially granted.

## R

**Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Vulnerability allowing attacker to execute code remotely.

**Return-Oriented Programming (ROP):** Exploit technique reusing existing code to bypass DEP.

**Root:** Highest privilege level on Unix-based systems (including Android).

## S

**Sandbox:** Security mechanism isolating applications from each other and the system.

**Secure Boot:** Process ensuring only cryptographically signed code runs during device startup.

**Spyware:** Software that covertly collects information from a device.

**System Call:** Interface between user programs and the kernel.

## V

**Vulnerability:** Security weakness that can be exploited.

## Z

**Zero-Click:** Exploit requiring no user interaction to succeed.

**Zero-Day:** Previously unknown vulnerability with no available patch.
